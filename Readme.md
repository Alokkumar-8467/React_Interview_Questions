# Q.1 What is react.js.
React is an open-source JavaScript library developed for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page web applications (SPA).

# Q.2 The Role of React in Software Development.
### React provides a structured, powerful, and efficient way to build the visual, interactive part of web applications, making it one of the most important and sought-after skills in software development today.
1. Enabling Complex, Interactive User Interfaces
2. Improving Developer Experience and Productivity
     Reusability
     Maintainability
     Readability
3. Driving the Modern Web: Single-Page Applications (SPAs)  
4. Creating a Vibrant Ecosystem and Community
5. Performance and Scalability

# Q.2 What are the major features of react.
### 1. Virtual DOM: 
React uses a virtual DOM to improve perfrmance by minimizing direct DOM manipulations. The Document Object Model (DOM) is the tree-like structure of a web page. Updating it directly is slow. React creates a Virtual DOMâ€”a lightweight copy of the real DOM in memory. When a component's state changes, React first updates this Virtual DOM. It then uses a "diffing algorithm" to compare the new Virtual DOM with the previous one, calculates the most efficient way to update the real browser DOM, and applies only those necessary changes. This makes applications incredibly fast and responsive.
### 2. JSX: 
JSX stands for JavaScript XML, which allows writing HTML in React components.
### 3. Components: 
React is components-based, meaning the UI is built using reusable components.
### 4. One-Way Data Binding: 
Data flows in one direction, making the application easier to understand and debug.
### 5. High Performance: 
React optimizes updates by using a virtual DOM and efficiently re-rendering components.
### 6. Unidirectional Data Flow: 
Data flow in a single direction, which provides better control over the entire application.
### 7. Component-Based: 
Instead of building a massive, complex webpage, you break the UI down into small, independent, and reusable pieces called Components. A "Button," a "SearchBar," a "UserProfile," or even an entire "Header" can be its own component. You then build complex UIs by composing these components together, like Lego bricks.
### 8. Declarative: 
With traditional JavaScript (the "imperative" approach), you write step-by-step instructions for how to update the UI (e.g., "find the div with ID 'message', and change its inner HTML to 'Hello!'"). With React's declarative approach, you simply describe what the UI should look like for a given state. React takes care of figuring out how to update the DOM to match that description. You say, "The UI should look like this," and React makes it happen.

# Q.3 What is virtual DOM and how it works.
Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components. React keeps a copy of the actual DOM structure in memory, called the Virtual DOM, and uses it to optimize updates and rendering.

# Q.4 What are components in react.
Components are the building block of a React application. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be nested, managed, and handled independently.
1. Class Based Components
2. Functional Components

# Q.5 Explain Class components with example.

When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.

The component has to include the extends React.Component statement, this statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

The component also requires a render() method, this method returns JSX/HTML.

```
import React, { Components } from 'react';

class ClassComponentExample extends Component {
  render() {
    return <h1> Hello </h1>
  }
}

export default ClassComponentExample;

```

# Q.5 Explain functional components with example.

ReactJS functional components are JavaScript functions that return a JSX element, which is a template used to define the component's structure. JSX looks similar to HTML, but it has a special syntax that lets it be converted into JavaScript code.

1. Stateless (before hooks): Originally, functional components were stateless and used only for rendering UI based on props.
2. Simpler Syntax: They are defined as JavaScript functions, leading to cleaner and more readable code.
3. Return JSX: Functional components return JSX (a syntax extension that allows HTML-like code inside JavaScript).
No, this keyword: Unlike class components, functional components do not have a this context.
4. Hooks: With hooks, functional components can manage state and side effects, making them just as powerful as class components.


#### 1. Functional Components
```
import React from 'react';

function FunctionalComponents() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>
}

export default FunctionalComponents;

```

#### 2. Functional Arrow based Components
```
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponents = () =>  {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>
}

export default FunctionalComponents;

```

# Q.6 What is JSX.
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without using methods like createElement() or appendChild().

```
import React from 'react';

const FunctionalComponents = () =>  {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>
}

export default FunctionalComponents;

                      ^
                      |
                      |

React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, world!")
                      
```                   


# Q.7 How to export and import components.

We can export components using **export default or named exports**, and import them using **import**.
